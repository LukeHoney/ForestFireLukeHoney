# Forest Fire Luke Honey’s Addition

The base of the Project was created by Swansea University and is an adaptation of the Game of Life but to show a Virtual Reality Version of that. Once loaded up the user will be surrounded in a forest that will soon catch on fire, the user can then explore the forest in their headset. My own adaptations are visible in the video and listed below.

##  Features:
### :chicken: Chickens to save
Make sure to look around for the 3 Chickens to save! Go and grab the piece of bread by the chicken hut and find the chickens before it’s too late! If they get hit by the fire 3 times, they won’t make it. Once you are close enough to them, they will follow you so take them to the magic chicken hut that will keep them safe from the fire. Be careful though, every time the game is loaded up the chicken will be in a new place. 

### :clipboard: Improve Pause Menu
A pause menu is included so the user can change their desired settings at any moment to turning on or off teleporting, changing the volume of the fire or putting snap turn on. To activate, simply press 'x' on your Quest 2 controller Once activated the whole game stops including the sound so there is no need to worry about your chickens while changing your settings.
